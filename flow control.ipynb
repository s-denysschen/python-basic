    "### Flow Control\n",
    "Flow control refers to the order in which the program's code executes. It might go in order, skip over some code, or keep repeating a block of code - this all depends on the flow control statements.\n",
    "### Flowcharts\n",
    "Flowcharts are diagrams that visually represent a process or a program. They're great for planning your program's flow control before you start coding.\n",
    "The most common symbols in flowcharts are:\n",
    "* Oval: Start or end of a program.\n",
    "* Rectangle: A command or operation.\n",
    "* Diamond: A decision or condition.\n",
    "Let's illustrate this with a simple program that checks if a number is positive or negative."
