    "Hey there! Welcome to a begginer's guide to the world of the most intuitive programming language - Python! Let's get our tools ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Installation\n",
    "First things first, we need to install Python. It's not hard:\n",
    "* Go to the Python downloads page at https://www.python.org/downloads/.\n",
    "* Download the latest Python version (Python 3.x.x, the exact version changes all the time).\n",
    "* Run the installer, and make sure to check the box that says \"Add Python 3.x to PATH\" before you click on \"Install Now\", or manually add the Pythin bin folder to your environment and system variables. \n",
    "* That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anaconda Installation\n",
    "Next, we gotta install Anaconda. It's a distribution of Python that comes with a lots of nifty libraries and tools:\n",
    "* Head to the Anaconda download page at https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#download-section.\n",
    "* Download the Python 3.x version.\n",
    "* Run the installer and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Anaconda comes with Jupyter Notebook, an open-source web-app that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, narrative text, and more. To start Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "* Open Anaconda Navigator (it gets installed with Anaconda).\n",
    "* Click on the Jupyter Notebook icon (pro tip: pin to taskbar for quicker launch).\n",
    "* Code along with a simple, shareable and interactive interface!"
